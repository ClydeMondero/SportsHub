<h1>Vulcan Sports Hub Term of Use</h1>
        <p>Date of last revision: December 2023</p>

        <p><b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE VULCAN SPORTS HUB PLATFORM.</b></p>

        <p><b>Welcome to the VULCAN SPORTS HUB community!  You are reading these Terms because you are using a VULCAN website, digital experience wearable 
            technology, or one of our other products or services, all of which are part of Vulcan Sports Hub's Platform (“Platform”).  
            You may access the Platform through a computer and mobile phone which we refer to here as a “Device”.  
            Your carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</b></p>

        <p><b>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and VULCAN and its affiliates 
            (which we may refer to as “VULCAN,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform.</b> Please review our List of Local 
            Entities for the name of the VULCAN entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact information. 
            A few important points:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Our Terms May Change.  Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer terms, 
                so this paragraph may not apply to you.</b> We may update these Terms from time to time. If a material change is made, 
                we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification.  Read through any changes, and if you don’t agree to 
                them, please stop using the Platform.  If you continue to use our Platform after we notify you of changes, you will be 
                deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Privacy Policy.</b> Our Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of personal information on the Platform and applies to your use of the Platform.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Be Responsible:</b> Inform VULCAN immediately of any unauthorized use of your VULCAN account.  You are responsible for 
            anything that happens through your VULCAN account – with or without your permission. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE

        </ul>
            <li><b>OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</b></li>
            <p> Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform - including text, 
                software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news 
                stories, sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content ("Content") - is owned by VULCAN or others we license
                Content from, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. VULCAN reserves all rights not expressly 
                described in these Terms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the VULCAN name and the Logo design) are owned, registered and/or 
                licensed by VULCAN.  You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names 
                through your access or use of the Platform or Content.</p></li>

                <li><p>You agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from materials downloaded or printed from the Platform.</p></li>

                <li><p>To the extent VULCAN approves the download or use of Content comprised of copyrights or copyrightable works, VULCAN 
                    grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access and use such 
                    copyrights or copyrightable works solely for their intended purpose and solely for as long as VULCAN makes such Content 
                    generally available to the public. You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content (including any trademarks or 
                    other intellectual property included in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal, non-commercial use.  
                    VULCAN reserves the right to monitor your use and to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at any time 
                    and for any reason. VULCAN reserves the right to take down any Content in violation of these terms or VULCAN’s intellectual 
                    property rights. VULCAN allowing you this limited use does not constitute a waiver of any of VULCAN’s rights to the Content.</p></li>

                <li><p>Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by VULCAN in connection with the Platform, you agree not to use, 
                    copy, edit, translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit 
                    any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally post on the Platform), without 
                    VULCAN’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a breach of copyright, trademark or other 
                    intellectual property laws and may subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.</p></li>
        </ul>   
                <li><b>POSTING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM</b></li>

                <p><b>User Content License. </b>Some parts of the Platform allow you to post photos, videos, comments, and other content, 
                    which we refer to as “User Content.”  VULCAN is not responsible for User Content others post to the Platform. User Content 
                    is owned by you or whoever created it, but when you post User Content you license it to VULCAN as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>You represent that you have the right to post your User Content, and you grant VULCAN a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, 
                sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any of the User Content that you post on or in connection with the Platform, 
                including the likeness of any person that appears in the User Content, or any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User Content, 
                for any purpose, including commercial use, which includes the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, 
                sublicense, distribute and assign these rights. VULCAN may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any time.</p></li>

                <li><p>You understand that deleted User Content may persist in VULCAN’s systems and on the Platform to the extent your User 
                    Content has been publicly posted or shared with others who have not deleted it, unless you or the relevant individual 
                    request deletion or blocking of personal data in accordance with applicable law.</p></li>
        </ul>
            <p><b>LICENSE TO USE COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND IDEAS.</b> You understand that <u>any comments, feedback, or ideas you send us are provided 
                    on a non-confidential basis and you grant to VULCAN a perpetual, worldwide license to use all comments, feedback and ideas</u>
                    you may share with us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you, for any purposes whatsoever, including, 
                    but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services and creating, modifying or improving 
                    products and services.</p>

                <p>We’re excited to have you contribute to the VULCAN community.  Here are a few basic rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Be Original.</b> Only post User Content to the Platform if you have all permissions and rights needed to make that User 
            Content available, including from any individuals who appear or are mentioned in your User Content.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Be Safe.</b></p></li>

            <li><p>Do not do anything that may expose VULCAN or its users to any type of harm, including anything that may disrupt, 
                damage, disable, tamper with, overburden or limit the functionality of the Platform.</p>
            <li><p>Do not post User Content that contains software viruses, programs or other computer code, and do not circumvent
