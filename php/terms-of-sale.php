        <p>1.2 Contacting us</p>
        <p>1.2.1 If you wish to contact us for any other reason, including because you have a
            complaint, please do so by e-mailing us at danShip@gmail.com.</p>

        <li><b>HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US</b></li>
        <p>2.1 We contract with retailers worldwide, so as to make such retailer's merchandise available in
            your country. In doing this we can provide you with landed cost visibility in multiple
            currencies on transactions involving such retailer's merchandise.</p>
        <p>2.2 By placing an order with us through our site, you acknowledge that your transaction will be
            with us and not with the respective retailer. You further acknowledge that upon successful
            verification by us of the authenticity and sufficiency of the information you provide, we will
            then purchase the merchandise from the respective retailer for the sole purpose of
            immediately reselling it to you for the amounts presented and agreed-upon when you
            submitted your order. We will be responsible for fulfilling the order to you.</p>
        <p>2.3 Our site will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order and make a
            payment with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before
            submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page
            of the order process</p>
        <p>2.4 After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have
            received your order. The Contract between us will only be formed when you receive your
            order confirmation email.</p>
        <p>2.5 We will send you an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been dispatched ("Dispatch
            Confirmation").</p>
        <p>2.6 If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in
            stock or no longer available or because of an error in the price on our site or the respective
            retailer’s site, we will inform you of this by e-mail and we will not process your order. If you
            have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery
            costs charged as soon as possible and will incur no further liability to you.</p>
        <p>2.7 Please note that any Products made available through our site are intended for
            non-commercial use, and purchase of any Products for resale purposes is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p>2.8 By placing an order or making a payment through our site, you warrant that you are legally
            capable of entering into binding contracts. Your card or other payment method
            will be billed by us and charges on your statement will be accompanied by the description
            "danShip" or similar. You warrant that all the information provided to us for the
            purpose of processing payments is correct and you are authorized to utilize the proffered
            payment method. You acknowledge that we will be entitled to verify the authenticity and

        <p>11.6 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not
            enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
            waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
            obligations.</p>
